Revision history for Perl extension Dist-Zilla-LocaleTextDomain

0.82
     - Fixed broken call to `log_fatal` in the `msg-init` command that caused
       the actual error to be lost in favor of a bad method call error. Thanks
       Joenio Costa for the patch.
     - Added a note on how to get Locale::TextDomain to return character
       strings instead of byte strings.
     - Fixed failing tets by skipping them when the installed versions of
       `xgettext` or `msgfmt` are too old (currently determined if they do not
       recognoze the `--version` option).
     - Now try to detect a compatible `gettext` in the path while building,
       and refuse to install if one cannot be found.

0.81  2012-10-02T16:25:43Z
      - Removed tests for the `add_lang` command, which was never shipped,
        but renamed `msg_init`.

0.80  2012-10-01T19:00:55Z
      - Switched from `system()` to IPC::Run3, so that STDOUT and STDERR
        messages can be passed to the Dist::Zilla logger.
      - Added new `dzil` commands:
        + `msg-scan` - Scan modules for messages to create translation template file
        + `msg-init` - Create a new language translation file
        + `msg-merge` - Merge message changes into translation files
      - Added short tutorial as main documentation, Dist::Zilla::LocaleTextDomain.
      
0.10  2012-09-06T22:12:48Z
      - Initial release with just the LocaleTextDomain plugin.
